                “I completed a one-on-one coaching series with Michael Zick and it was an
                overwhelmingly positive experience. He provided me with a unique service I
                haven’t experienced in any therapist or doctors office - NO cookie cutter
                solutions.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[23px]">
                Instead, he helped me uncover my challenges, hiding under the surface, and we
                worked at them together. Michael Zick has a deep well of empathy, knowledge and
                tools to help virtually anyone. He’s done the hard personal work himself.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[23px]">
                Michael helped and pushed me to discover what it is that I was needing, then gave
                me perspective, feedback, and tools to move through to a place of better clarity
                and self knowledge.”

                “I think following that tiny voice in your head is what leads you to the most
                amazing surprises! I was online one day looking at dating blogs, dating apps, and
                dating groups when I stumbled onto a group of people at a free zoom meeting that
                Michael was offering about dating. I liked what we all talked about, how Michael
                responded to everybody, and that I was offered a free 45 minute coaching session
                with him. I was really surprised with how in-tuned he was and how much he was able
                to help me in that one session. He was able to really hear in between things I was
                saying and know what was important to bring up!
              </p>
              <p className="text-[23px]">
                I went ahead and agreed to some more coaching with him. He really has a gift and
                he doesn’t feel like someone that was just in it for the money. I’m super grateful I
                stumbled onto Michael Zick! I’ve seen some amazing changes in my world already,
                not just in the dating realm, but all kinds of amazing revelations and changes are
                happening in other areas of my life, too.”

              “When I think about what makes a great coach in any discipline, I think about
              someone that is not only encouraging and knowledgeable in a particular area, but
              someone who helps you to see your own seeds of greatness. The best coaches are
              experts at finding those seeds in you. They water and nurture them until they take
              root. As you cultivate your skills and tools, they help you identify and remove the
              weeds that would inevitably subvert your growth. They are the shepherds of your
              vision and the guide to uncovering your potential.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a life coach and mentor, Michael Zick has been a true shepherd and guide. His
              ability to help me cut through the noise and realize I already have the answers and
              direction I need is a true gift. I have been truly blessed to have him as a coach, a
              friend, and that kick in the pants when I needed it. I highly recommend Michael to
              help those wanting to uncover their own greatness.”

              “When I came to Michael for coaching, I was brand new to the process. I thought it
              would be more advice driven but it wasn’t. I want to say thank you, Michael! You
              have made a substantial impact on my life, not by telling me what I need to do, but
              by guiding me to find the answers myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              You consistently asked probing questions to get me to seek answers from within, and
              then continued to drill down to get to the specifics of each issue. This has had a
              powerful and empowering effect that has given me motivation and excitement to pursue
              my dreams.
            </p>

              Couldn’t be happier! I highly recommend you and the service you provide.”

              “For me, working with a life coach is rooted in their ability to recognize blindspots
              and obstacles that may be limiting my growth. Michael has that unique ability to help
              me see the unseen. He brings his complete and total presence to the work and a
              mindset that encourages looking inward as well as outward to define your growing edge
              and push beyond it. There are no shortcuts or quick-fixes in his approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through Michael’s guidance, I established a clear vision for my professional and
              personal goals, created a tangible plan to work through my challenges, and identified
              tools to manage the accountability process. That clarity of purpose and direction were
              exactly what I was seeking.”
