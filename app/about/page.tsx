                He stands by the phrase, &quot;We don&apos;t think our way into right action; we act our
                way into right thinking.&quot; In other words, replacing worrying with doing is the
                path to success that Michael encourages, and his clients have the results to show
                for it.
              </p>
              <p className="text-[23px]">
                He has worked with the best of the best — from top business and marketing
                coaches to world-renowned relationship experts like Dr. Glover and Erwan and
                Alicia Davon.

                With his no-BS approach, those who work with Michael will know what it&apos;s like to
                replace rumination with action, take ownership of their thoughts, feelings, and
                behaviors, stop being a victim, and play well with others without being &quot;nice.&quot;
